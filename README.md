# echo-sample-arch

Sample of simple web server built using Echo framework.

## Goal of This Project

I want to explore the [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/) framework, one of the popular Go framework.

In this current state, it only shows the bare minimum usage of Echo as a web server.

To run this project, simply run this from the root of the project:
```
go run main.go
```
